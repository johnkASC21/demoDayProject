This website allows users to generate coupon codes for items or fun activities. This website will also have a search feature where the user can search for the items or activities that they want. They can also use the drop down menu to look for the catagories they would like to look for. There will be a contacts section where our emails will be and images for some of the products. The other page will have answers to simple questions that the user may have. If anything, we have our contact info for more of the complex questions and help. 

There’s plenty of fun things to do. Skiing, Skydiving, going to museums. But they’re always so expensive. What about some useful things like baby necessities, dental health or skincare. It would be nice if these things cost less money. This is why we created a website that will help you find the things you want and need for a much cheaper price.
